Outside of work, I love to cook, run and learn new things. Currently, I’m learning Rust and iOS development. The things that interest me the most are history, social movements, futurist technologies, and fitness. As I write this, the German Peasants’ War of 1524 is what is on top of my mind. Especially why most medeival peasant revolts failed until the larger forces that converged around the French revolution.">
