      <description>&lt;p&gt;After graduating, I worked for over four years with non-profits, local governments, and state departments in India. The experience was enriching and exhilarating enough that I knew I wanted to continue in the same domain for the foreseeable future. Public Policy is a nebulous field—I didn’t know I was a part of it (until it was too late). As I explored possible education options, I received plenty of advice and guidance from colleagues and even strangers. Here, I want to pass on some of that advice and explain why I opted for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://capp.uchicago.edu/&#34;&gt;MSCAPP (MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy)&lt;/a&gt; program—and why you might want to consider it too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
