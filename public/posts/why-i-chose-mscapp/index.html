			<p>After graduating, I worked for over four years with non-profits, local governments, and state departments in India. The experience was enriching and exhilarating enough that I knew I wanted to continue in the same domain for the foreseeable future. Public Policy is a nebulous field—I didn’t know I was a part of it (until it was too late). As I explored possible education options, I received plenty of advice and guidance from colleagues and even strangers. Here, I want to pass on some of that advice and explain why I opted for the <a href="https://capp.uchicago.edu/">MSCAPP (MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy)</a> program—and why you might want to consider it too.</p>
<p>I started thinking about potential programs a year and a half before Fall 2019—my target period. I was surrounded by people keen on (or already holding) a Master’s in Public Policy, and it seemed like a natural progression given the work I was doing at Swaniti.</p>
<h4 id="advice-on-mpp">Advice on MPP</h4>
<p>The mainstream view I encountered was that an MPP was a relatively new program designed to solve complex social challenges that have emerged over the past few decades. It recognizes the cross-disciplinary nature of global issues such as climate change and economic inequality by providing students with a strong foundation in economics, statistics, and political science, followed by specializations in specific policy fields. Graduates are eligible for a wide range of roles—from government bureaucrats and non-profit leaders to consulting analysts and academic researchers.</p>
<p>A common analogy was that an MPP is like an MBA for the development and public policy space. It’s significantly cheaper than an MBA and offers a curriculum with a strong social justice orientation.</p>
<p>However, there were also cynical views. Some argued that an MPP is a poor substitute for a Master’s in Economics or other traditional fields from which it borrows. Critics noted that apart from the top four or five programs, many MPP programs were mediocre and not worth the investment. There were concerns about the program’s young age, vague focus, lower market value, and limited job opportunities post-graduation. While I didn’t entirely share this cynicism, I was made aware of the employment challenges associated with some MPP programs by multiple graduates.</p>
<h4 id="alternatives-to-mpp">Alternatives to MPP</h4>
<p>Working with various government entities in India, I identified the intersection of technology and governance as a major pain point—one that I could address using my technical background. I was concerned that a traditional MPP might not suit this career trajectory. Conversations with friends and alumni repeatedly highlighted issues like limited employment opportunities and a lack of hard skills in many MPP programs.</p>
<p>I began searching for cross-disciplinary programs that would combine my background in policy and development with my passion for programming. I wanted a program that would offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wider employment opportunities post-graduation</li>
<li>A solid foundation in computer science</li>
<li>An evergreen skill set</li>
<li>Access to a talented and supportive alumni network</li>
<li>STEM designation, which would allow me to work in the US for an additional two years to help repay student loans</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn’t long before I narrowed it down to three programs in the US. Based on program descriptions, online forums, and conversations with alumni, I ranked them as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>MS in Computational Analysis and Public Policy (MSCAPP) at University of Chicago</strong><br>
+Relatively older and more established<br>
+Co-offered with the Computer Science department<br>
-Limited number of electives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MS in Public Policy and Data Analytics (MSPPM-DA) at Carnegie Mellon University</strong><br>
+Known for offering more financial aid<br>
+More flexible coursework<br>
-Co-offered with the School of Information Systems and Management rather than CMU’s highly reputed Computer Science department</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MS in Data Science for Public Policy (DSPP) at Georgetown University</strong><br>
+Small cohort<br>
-New program with no graduates yet<br>
-Most expensive of the three programs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>MSCAPP was my clear favorite, with MSPPM-DA coming in a close second and DSPP lagging behind.</p>
<h4 id="mscapp--pros">MSCAPP – Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Established Program:</strong> MSCAPP has been around long enough to have multiple cohorts who have successfully found employment.</li>
<li><strong>Reputable Partnership:</strong> The collaboration between the Harris School of Public Policy and the UChicago Computer Science department is highly appealing.</li>
<li><strong>Optimal Cohort Size:</strong> With around 50–60 students, the program offers a network that is large enough to be valuable but small enough for individual attention.</li>
<li><strong>Responsive Admissions:</strong> UChicago/Harris was very responsive during the application process.</li>
<li><strong>Positive Reviews:</strong> The feedback from current students and alumni has been overwhelmingly positive.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mscapp--cons">MSCAPP – Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course Structure:</strong> The program is divided into six quarters with three courses each. Out of 18 courses, 11 are core (5 related to computer science and 6 from Harris). While the computer science core was strong, the Harris core didn’t fully align with the policy classes I was interested in.</li>
<li><strong>Networking Concerns:</strong> I was worried about networking opportunities in Chicago, as many international organizations I was interested in are based in Washington, DC, or New York.</li>
<li><strong>Harsh Winters:</strong> Chicago winters are notably cold, and having already worked in the frigid Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, I was not eager to face another harsh winter.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="application-overview">Application Overview</h4>
<p>The application process was straightforward. I applied only to MSCAPP and DSPP—the latter because a complicated transcript and credential evaluation requirement by CMU emerged just days before their deadline. Ultimately, I received acceptances from both MSCAPP and DSPP. With a competitive aid offer from MSCAPP, the decision was easy.</p>
<p>(I’ll detail the application process in another post.)</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>As someone with programming experience and a strong background in public policy, MSCAPP was an attractive alternative to traditional MPP programs. The combination of computer science and policy education appealed to my career goals. MSCAPP’s long track record, integration with the Computer Science department, and strong alumni network made it the clear choice. Consequently, I accepted the offer and enrolled in the MSCAPP program.</p>
