## About Me

Hi! I'm a 31 year old man living in NYC. I was born and raised in a city called Pune in India and moved to the US at the age of 26 for grad school. In a past life, I worked across non-profits and public policy consulting. Now I've pivoted to tech.

Outside of work, I love to cook, run and learn new things. Currently, I'm learning Rust and iOS development. The things that interest me the most are history, social movements, futurist technologies, and fitness. As I write this, the [German Peasants' War of 1524](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Peasants%27_War) is what is on top of my mind. Especially why most medeival peasant revolts failed until the larger forces that converged around the French revolution. 

If you want to chat about anything, especially on any of my posts, don't hesitate to reach out.
